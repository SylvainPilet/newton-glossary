# The Newton Glossary

#### An almost definitive guide to Newton-related terms and definitions.

[glossary.splorp.me](http://glossary.splorp.me/)


## About

The bulk of the terms found in this glossary were compiled from numerous [sources](http://glossary.splorp.me/sources) by [Grant Hutchinson](http://splorp.com/) between 2001 and 2004, with help from [Paul Guyot](http://www.kallisys.com/), [Victor Rehorst](http://www.chuma.org/), and countless members of the [NewtonTalk](http://newtontalk.net/) community.

There is also a [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary created by Victor Rehorst and currently maintained by [Morgan Aldridge](http://makkintosshu.com/) as part of the [United Network of Newton Archives](http://www.unna.org/).

As with any specialized compendium, the contents are never perfect or completely finished. All suggestions, corrections, complaints, and [pull requests](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/pulls) will be happily accepted. If possible, please use the project’s [issue tracker](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/issues) for any input you might have.

## Colophon

This iteration of the glossary is formatted in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using plain text files and published using [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/) — an extensible content management system build on PHP.

For peace of mind and ease of maintenance, the project resides in a public [GitHub](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/) repository.

To add a bit of spit and shine to our Kirby experience, we’re also using the following handy dandy plugins.
