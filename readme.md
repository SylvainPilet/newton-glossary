# The Newton Glossary

#### The almost definitive guide to Newton-related terms and definitions.

The majority of the terms found in this glossary were compiled by [Grant Hutchinson](http://splorp.com/) between 2001 and 2004, with gobs of help from [Paul Guyot](http://www.kallisys.com/), [Victor Rehorst](http://www.chuma.org/), and members of the [NewtonTalk](http://newtontalk.net/) community.

As with any specialized compendium, the contents are never perfect or completely finished. All suggestions, corrections, complaints, and pull requests will be happily accepted.

There is also a [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary created by Victor Rehorst and currently maintained by [Morgan Aldridge](https://github.com/morgant) as part of the [United Network of Newton Archives](http://www.unna.org/).


## Why GitHub?

GitHub is a simple way to host, share, and apply the “peace of mind” of version control to all sorts of code. This iteration of the Newton Glossary is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and published using [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/), a file-based CMS platform built on PHP. Since the content will undoubtedly go through countless changes by multiple contributors over time — GitHub seemed like a perfect place to maintain it.
