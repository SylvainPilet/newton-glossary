Title: Style Guide

----

Text:

## Abbreviations (used as a “see also” pointing at expanded term)

Only include the abbreviated term in the related terms of the expanded term. Do not include the abbreviated term in other terms.

_For example:_

[Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit) should list [NTK](/terms/ntk) as a related term because it is the actual abbreviation for [Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit).

However, [project build](/terms/project-build) should list [Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit), not [NTK](/terms/ntk).

## Abbreviations (more common than the expanded term)

_For example:_

[PCMCIA](/terms/pcmcia) is an acronym that is more commonly used than its expanded variation — _Personal Computer Memory Card International Association_. In this case, the expanded term would be included as the first part of the abbreviation’s entry.

## Shortened terms

Whenever possible, use the longer version of a term for clarity.

_For example:_

Use “telephone” not “phone”
Use “operating system” not “system”
Use “Newton device” not “Newton”
Use “Newton OS” not “NOS”

## Referring to other terms

Use “Also referred to as …” if the referenced term is as common or less common than the source term.
Use “Commonly referred to as …” if the referenced term is more common than the source term.
Use “Mistakenly referred to as …” if the referenced term is an commonly misspelled or mangled version of the source term.

## Capitalization of terms

## Indicating menu items, windows, slips, and other named user interface elements

Other than using their proper capitalized names, should these items be wrapped in quotes or styled in some other way?

_For example:_

Ink words are created when the user has selected [Ink Text](/terms/ink-text) in the “Recognition Preferences” slip.

## Additional information

When linking to the main page of a website, include both the site name and “Website” as part of the link text.

_For example:_

[Catamount Software Website](http://www.catamount.com/)

When linking to a specific article or resource on a site, use the full name or title of the article or resource as the link text. Include the website name as the source of the article or resource after the link text. If the article or resource is available from multiple locations, the source text should specific this.

_For example:_

[The NewtonScript Programming Language](http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/NewtonScriptProgramLanguage.PDF) _Apple_
[The NewtonScript Programming Language](http://www.unna.org/unna/apple/documentation/developer/NewtonScriptProgLanguage.pdf) _UNNA_
[プログラミング言語 NewtonScript](https://web.archive.org/web/19970712004703/http://www.k-inet.com/~brown/plns.html) (Japanese Translation) _Internet Archive_
