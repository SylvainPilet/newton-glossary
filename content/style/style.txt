## Abbreviations (used as a “see also” pointing at expanded term)

Only include the abbreviated term in the related terms of the expanded term. Do not include the abbreviated term in other terms.

_For example:_

[Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit) should list [NTK](/terms/ntk) as a related term.

However, [project build](/terms/project-build) should list [Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit), not [NTK](/terms/ntk).

## Abbreviations (more common than the expanded term)

_For example:_

[PCMCIA](/terms/pcmcia) is an acronym that is more commonly used than its expanded variation — _Personal Computer Memory Card International Association_. In this case, the expanded term would be included as the first part of the abbreviation’s entry.

## More commonly known as …

## Capitalization of terms

## Indicating menu items, windows, slips, and other named user interface elements

Other than using their proper capitalized names, should these items be wrapped in quotes or styled in some other way?

_For example:_

Ink words are created when the user has selected [Ink Text](/terms/ink-text) in the “Recognition Preferences” slip.
