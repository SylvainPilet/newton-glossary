Text:

The majority of the terms found in this glossary were compiled by [Grant Hutchinson](http://splorp.com/) between 2001 and 2004, with gobs of help from [Paul Guyot](http://www.kallisys.com/), [Victor Rehorst](http://www.chuma.org/), and members of the [NewtonTalk](http://newtontalk.net/) community.

As with any specialized compendium, the contents are never perfect or completely finished. All suggestions, corrections, complaints, and pull requests will be happily accepted.

There is also a [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary created by Victor Rehorst and currently maintained by [Morgan Aldridge](https://github.com/morgant) as part of the [United Network of Newton Archives](http://www.unna.org/).
