Text:

The majority of the terms found in this glossary were compiled by [Grant Hutchinson](http://splorp.com/) between 2001 and 2004, with gobs of help from [Paul Guyot](http://www.kallisys.com/), [Victor Rehorst](http://www.chuma.org/), and members of the [NewtonTalk](http://newtontalk.net/) community.

As with any specialized compendium, the contents are never perfect or completely finished. All suggestions, corrections, complaints, and pull requests will be happily accepted.

This iteration of the glossary is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and published using [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/), a file-based CMS platform built on PHP. Since the content will undoubtedly go through countless changes by multiple contributors over time, it is being maintained in a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/).

There is also a [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary created by Victor Rehorst and currently maintained by [Morgan Aldridge](https://github.com/morgant) as part of the [United Network of Newton Archives](http://www.unna.org/).
