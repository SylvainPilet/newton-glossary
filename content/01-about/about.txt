Text:

The bulk of the terms found in this glossary were compiled from numerous [sources](/sources) by [Grant Hutchinson](http://splorp.com/) between 2001 and 2004, with help from [Paul Guyot](http://www.kallisys.com/), [Victor Rehorst](http://www.chuma.org/), and members of the [NewtonTalk](http://newtontalk.net/) community.

This iteration of the glossary is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and published using [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/), a file-based CMS platform built on PHP. Since the content will undoubtedly go through countless changes by multiple contributors over time, it is being maintained in a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/).

There is also a [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary created by Victor Rehorst and currently maintained by [Morgan Aldridge](https://github.com/morgant) as part of the [United Network of Newton Archives](http://www.unna.org/).

As with any specialized compendium, the contents are never perfect or completely finished. All suggestions, corrections, complaints, and [pull requests](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/pulls) will be happily accepted. If possible, please use the projectâ€™s [issue tracker](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/issues) for any input you might have.
