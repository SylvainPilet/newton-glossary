Title: About

----

Text:

The original idea behind the creation of the [Newton Glossary](/) was to provide a single, accessible resource for terminology related specifically to the Newton.

The majority of terms found in the glossary were compiled between 2001 and 2004 by [Grant Hutchinson](http://splorp.com/). Numerous [sources](/sources) were used, along with plenty of help from [Paul Guyot](http://www.kallisys.com/), [Victor Rehorst](http://www.chuma.org/), and countless members of the [NewtonTalk](http://newtontalk.net/) community.

Although it’s a bit out of date, there is also a [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary currently maintained by [Morgan Aldridge](http://www.makkintosshu.com/) as part of the [United Network of Newton Archives](http://www.unna.org/).

At one point there was also a [Newton Book](/terms/newton-book) version of the glossary. We’ll see if we can make that happen again.

## Join The Fun!

## Colophon

This iteration of the glossary is formatted in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using plain text files and published using [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) — an extensible content management system build on PHP.

The entire project resides in a public [GitHub](https://github.com/splorp/newton-glossary/) repository. This provides easy access for contributors, almost painless maintenance, and peace of mind.

To add a bit of spit and shine to our Kirby experience, we’ve also used the following handy dandy plugins from time to time.
