Text:

An unordered collection of [slots](/terms/slot), each of which consists of a name and value pair. The value of a slot can be any type of [object](/terms/object), and slots can be added or removed from frames dynamically. A frame can have a user-specified [class](/terms/class). Frames can be used like records in Pascal and structs in C, and also as objects that respond to [messages](/terms/message).
