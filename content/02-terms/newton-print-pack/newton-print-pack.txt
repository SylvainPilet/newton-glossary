Title: Newton Print Pack

----

Text:

Developed by [Apple](http://apple.com/), the Newton Print Pack was originally a serial to parallel adapter with built-in, ROM-based drivers that allowed a user to print from a Newton device to various desktop printers. A later version of the Newton Print Pack was entirely software based and could be used with third party adapters and cables. Also referred to as [NPP](/terms/npp).
