Text:

A list of branching instructions for the microprocessor, indirectly pointing to native [functions](/terms/function). For each version of the [ROM](/terms/rom) in Newton OS 2.0 and later, the functions always reside at the same offset in the [jumptable](/terms/jumptable). Native programs can call these functions via the public jumptable and they will work on every [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) device. The public jumptable also contains a series of branches pointing to the [patchable jumptable](/terms/patchable-jumptable).
