Text:

An [easter egg](/terms/easter-egg) found in the [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) related to selecting the infamous “Area 51” in the [Time Zones](/terms/time-zones) application. When activated, [icons](/terms/icon) in the [Date Book](/terms/date-book) application are changed to reflect an alien theme. For example, a meeting is represented by a person facing an alien, an event is changed to a flying saucer, and to-do tasks are represented by a robot.

On a [MessagePad 130](/terms/messagepad-130), the “Area 51” location is replaced by either [Groom Lake](/terms/groom-lake) or [Dreamland](/terms/dreamland).

Also referred to as the [Aliens](/terms/aliens) easter egg.
