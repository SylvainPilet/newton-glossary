Ruby Desktop Connection Library

A Ruby-based communication framework created by [Eckhart KÃ¶ppen](/sources/eckhart-koppen). Taking a cue from the earlier [DCL](/terms/dcl), RDCL was designed to connect to and interact with data stored on devices running [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) 2.0 and later via the built-in [dock](/terms/dock) protocol. Connections are usually performed via serial cable, but higher level [protocol](/terms/protocol) layers can also run over other connection methods such as [TCP/IP](/terms/tcp-ip).
