----

Text:

To suspend the activity of an [application](/terms/application) or [extension](/terms/extension) package. Freezing a [package](/terms/package) is similar to removing an [external store](/terms/external-store) that a package is stored on. In most cases, a [frozen package](/terms/frozen-package) should free up memory on the Newton device.

To reactivate a package, you [thaw](/terms/thaw) it.
