Text:

An implementation of the [Lisp](/terms/lisp) programming language for Mac OS computers. Often referred to as simply [MCL](/terms/mcl), it was also a development environment that provided tight integration with the Mac OS toolbox. A prototype for the [Newton Toolkit](/terms/newton-toolkit) development environment called [EtchASketch](/terms/etchasketch) was written by [Maurice Sharp](/sources/maurice-sharp) using Macintosh Common Lisp.
