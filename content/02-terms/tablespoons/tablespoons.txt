Title: Tablespoons

----

Text:

A mangled translation of “Jabberwocky”. When [Robert McNally](/sources/robert-mcnally) entered Lewis Carroll’s famous poem into an original Newton device, the [handwriting recognition](/terms/handwriting-recognition) generated what was basically a new lyric poem, with “Tablespoons” as its title. Also known as [Newtonwocky](/terms/newtonwocky).
