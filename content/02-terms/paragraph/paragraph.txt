What [Catamount Software](/sources/catamount) mistakenly calls the [cursive recognizer](/terms/cursive-recognizer) in its documentation. This is likely due to the fact that [ParaGraph International](/sources/paragraph) developed the [CalliGrapher](/terms/calligrapher) handwriting recognition system used on Newton devices.
