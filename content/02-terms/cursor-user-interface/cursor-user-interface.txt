Text:

A visually distinct mark indicating where newly typed text will be inserted. The cursor moves as text is typed and can also be moved by the user to change the insertion point within a document or [field](/terms/field). Using different graphic representations, the cursor can also indicate system status, such as a [busy cursor](/terms/busy-cursor).
