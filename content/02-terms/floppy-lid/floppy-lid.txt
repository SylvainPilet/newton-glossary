Title: Floppy Lid

----

Text:

The result of the failure of the tension spring found in the hinge of an [eMate](/terms/emate-300) lid. The tension spring will normally hold the lid and [screen](/terms/screen) at any given angle. When the tension spring fails, the lid flops down. Also known as the “dreaded hinge problem” or [DHP](/terms/dhp).
