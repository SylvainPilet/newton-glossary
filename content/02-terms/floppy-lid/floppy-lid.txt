Title: Floppy Lid

----

Text:

The result of the hinge tension spring failing in the [clamshell](/terms/clamshell) lid of an [eMate](/terms/emate-300). The tension spring will normally hold the lid and [screen](/terms/screen) at any given angle. When the tension spring fails, the lid flops down. Also known as the “dreaded hinge problem” or [DHP](/terms/dhp).
