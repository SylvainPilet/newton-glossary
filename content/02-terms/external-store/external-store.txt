Title: External Store

----

Text:

An memory [card](/terms/card-pc) that stores packages and user data. Called an external [store](/terms/store) because it is a physical accessory that must be plugged into the [PCMCIA](/terms/pcmcia) slot of a Newton device, as opposed to an [internal store](/terms/internal-store).
