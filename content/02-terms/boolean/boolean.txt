Title: Boolean

----

Text:

A special kind of immediate value. In [NewtonScript](/terms/newtonscript), there is only one Boolean, called true. Functions and control structures use [nil](/terms/nil) to represent false. When testing for a value, nil represents false, and any other value is equivalent to true.
