One of two known NuBus-based cards that facilitated the running of a self-contained Newton development environment on a Macintosh [desktop computer](/terms/desktop-computer). [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) apparently planned to produce these cards in volume for developers, but they proved to be too expensive. It is believed that only 50 or so cards were ever made. Shortly after the cards were introduced, prototype [MessagePad](/terms/messagepad) devices appeared which could be used for development. [Debugger](/terms/debugger) software such as [Egger](/terms/egger) and [Hammer](/terms/hammer) was required in order to utilize these cards.

The ARMageddon card preceded the [ARMistice](/terms/armistice) card. They were so named because of the [ARM](/terms/arm) processor used in the Newton hardware.
