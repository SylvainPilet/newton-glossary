Title: Dictionary

----

Text:

A system construct against which [input](/terms/input) strings are matched, as a means of ensuring valid output from the [cursive](/terms/cursive-recognizer) and [print](/terms/print-recognizer) text recognizers. The [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) supplies [system dictionaries](/terms/system-dictionary) that define names, places, dates, times, telephone numbers, and commonly used words to the text recognizers. The user can expand the default vocabulary by adding new words to a [user dictionary](/terms/user-dictionary).
