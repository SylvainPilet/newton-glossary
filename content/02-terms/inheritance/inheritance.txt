Title: Inheritance

----

Text:

The mechanism by which attributes ([slots](/terms/slot) or data) and behaviors ([methods](/terms/method)) are made available to [objects](/terms/object). Parent inheritance allows [views](/terms/view) of dissimilar types to share slots containing data or methods. Prototype inheritance allows a [template](/terms/template) to base its definition on that of another template or prototype.
