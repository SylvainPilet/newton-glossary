Title: Frankenbuckey

----

Text:

An internal project at [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) which integrated a keyboard into the screen cover of a [MessagePad 2000](/terms/messagepad-2000) or [MessagePad 2100](/terms/messagepad-2100). There were purportedly two versions of the Frankenbuckey. One was an enclosure with a built-in keyboard that held the Newton device and the other design replaced the standard screen cover with one that integrated a keyboard.
