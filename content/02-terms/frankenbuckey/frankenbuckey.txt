Title: Frankenbuckey

----

Text:

An internal project at [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) which combined a keyboard and screen cover for a [MessagePad 2000](/terms/messagepad-2000) or [MessagePad 2100](/terms/messagepad-2100) device.

There were reportedly two versions of the Frankenbuckey, also referred to as an “Integrated Accessories Investigation” by the third-party industrial design firm working with Apple. One was an enclosure with a built-in keyboard that held the Newton device and the other design replaced the standard screen cover with one that integrated a keyboard.
