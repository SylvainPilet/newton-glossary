Title: Original MessagePad

----

Text:

The first commercially released Newton model. Not to be confused with the [MessagePad 100](/terms/messagepad-100) which shares the same model number ([H1000](/terms/h1000)) and form factor. The beta release of the device was originally called the [Notepad], the name being changed to [MessagePad](/terms/messagepad) to better reflect its communication capabilities. Commonly referred to as [OMP](/terms/omp).

The term “Original MessagePad” can also refer to any non-upgraded MessagePad, such as a [MessagePad 2000](/terms/messagepad-2000) without the optional memory expansion.
