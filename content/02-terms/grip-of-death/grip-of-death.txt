Text:

A system [freeze](/terms/freeze) common in early [MessagePad](/terms/messagepad) devices caused by a lack of adequate [heap space](/terms/heap-space). In later versions of the [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) this condition notified the user of a problem instead of causing the [operating system](terms/operating-system) to become unresponsive.
