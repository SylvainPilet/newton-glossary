AllPen has developed and deployed successful solutions for the small memory footprint device marketplace; including hand-held devices, screen-phones, set-top boxes, PDAs, and other Internet appliances. AllPen has developed and licensed several of their technologies to Fortune 500 firms in this space. A key part of AllPen's mission is to assist clients in meeting their productivity goals by planning, developing, and implementing integrated systems that fully utilize these technologies.

AllPen, a privately held California corporation, was founded in July of 1993 by Ivan and Wayne Yurtin. Their extensive experience in the computer industry includes highly technical software engineering, systems integration, and software project management for complex systems.
