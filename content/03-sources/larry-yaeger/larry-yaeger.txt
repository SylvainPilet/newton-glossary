After a number of years using Polyworld to study the evolution of neural complexity and teaching Artificial Life as an approach to Artificial Intelligence and introductory computer programming at Indiana University, he is now happily back to writing software and solving new challenging problems, this time for Google, in Mountain View, CA.
