# Newton Glossary

## The almost definitive guide to Newton-related terms and definitions.

The Newton Glossary has been compiled by [Grant Hutchinson](http://splorp.com/), with gobs of help from [Paul Guyot](http://www.kallisys.com/) and [Victor Rehorst](http://www.chuma.org/).

Nothing is absolutely perfect or completely finished, so if you have a suggestion or a correction for the glossary, please send a message to [glossary@splorp.com](mailto:glossary@splorp.com).

You can also search for specific terms using the [searchable version](http://tools.unna.org/glossary/) of the glossary.

Go grab yourself a random term from the searchable glossary. Courtesy of Victor Rehorst.

## Why GitHub?

GitHub is a simple way to host, share, and apply the “peace of mind” of version control to all sorts of code. Since the Newton Glossary is written in [Markdown]() and will (theoretically) go through hundreds of changes, updates, and iterations over time - GitHub seemed like a perfect place to maintain it.
